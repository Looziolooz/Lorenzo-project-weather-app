# Weather App

The project involved developing a weather web application by retrieving data from the OpenWeatherMap API. It encompassed features like showcasing current weather information, displaying sunrise/sunset timings, and presenting a 4-day weather forecast. Additionally, the application needed to be styled to resemble one of the provided designs and ensure responsiveness across different screen sizes.

## The problem

I found a lot of difficulty in completing this project, especially regarding the use of branches. I had to redo the project twice. I extracted the styling part from Figma (font, colors, dimensions), while for the last part concerning the forecast, I had to search for information on Google and ChatGPT. Now, I have a clearer understanding of using branches, including how to extract data from the API.
