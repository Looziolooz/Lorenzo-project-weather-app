# Weather App

The project involved developing a weather web application by retrieving data from the OpenWeatherMap API. It encompassed features like showcasing current weather information, displaying sunrise/sunset timings, and presenting a 4-day weather forecast. Additionally, the application needed to be styled to resemble one of the provided designs and ensure responsiveness across different screen sizes.

## The problem

I found a lot of difficulty in completing this project, especially regarding the use of branches. I had to redo the project twice. I extracted the styling part from Figma (font, colors, dimensions), while for the last part concerning the forecast, I had to search for information on Google and ChatGPT. Now, I have a clearer understanding of using branches, including how to extract data from the API.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
